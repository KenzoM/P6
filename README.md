\Udacity Project 6--Feed Reader Testing
Version 1.0.0 6/12/2015

##General Usage
- The puprose of this project is to understand users the usage of Jasmine.js for testing functions in the web applications.

- Using Jasmine's library, as well as pre-written HTML/JS code that utilizes Google Feed API, users were instruscted to write some tests function to make sure the web application is working correctly.

-These tests include:
	-RSS feeds object:
		-are defined
		-URL property are defined
		-Name property are defined

	- The menu:
		-is hidden by default
		-should toggle visible/hidden when clicked

	-Initial Entries:
		-feed elements are load asynchronously 

	-New Feed Selection:
		-new feed content is changed when choosing different index


##How To Open
1) Before starting the application, make sure that you have network connectivity.

2) Open the index.html in your  favorite browser.

3) Open your text-editor application and observe how the web application works. This will give you a better understanding on how to utilize Jasmine.js effectively. 

4) After understanding the index.html and app.js, refer to feedreader.js to use Jasmine.js and test the web application on various tasks.
